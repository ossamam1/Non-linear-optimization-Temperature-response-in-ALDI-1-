Non-linear optimization temperature response in ALDI-1 contains multiple files.
Download the CasAdi package from the official website: https://web.casadi.org/
CasADI package is an open source package and it is required to run the matlab code for non-linear optimization.
ALD-TEST.m is the main code file.
ALD_atmospheric_data.mat and ALD_vacuum_data.mat are tablar data holding files (conneciton hub set temperature, desired reactor bed temperature, and reactor furnace set temperature) for the experiment performed at atmoshperic and vacuum conditions
