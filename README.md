The non-linear optimization temperature response in ALDI-1 contains multiple files. Download the CasAdi package from the official website: https://web.casadi.org/ . CasADI package is an open-source package required to run the Matlab code for non-linear optimization.
ALD-TEST.m is the main code file. ALD_atmospheric_data.mat and ALD_vacuum_data.mat are tabular data holding files (connection hub set temperature, desired reactor bed temperature, and reactor furnace set temperature) for the experiment performed at atmospheric and vacuum conditions.
